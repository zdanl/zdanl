### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**zdanl** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because it contains and will contain âœ¨`ethical`âœ¨ code and projects for improving (digital) life. I am interested in a variety of technological and scientific subjects, and have vivid insight into a variety of industries. Some of the prospective achievements require further learning and insight, while others require just funding or work. I am using this Github to elaborate on what is planned, and why you care. I am an undergrad in Computer Science at Internationale Hochschule.

Here are some things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning and working on Python3 libraries mostly for educational purposes, ARM64 research and project planning, LLVM + clang source code review and patching to implement Instruction Set Randomization, and market research into the semiconductor sector. Compilers & Lexers for creating a Python3 syntax and grammar based memory-safe language for low-level engineering with high-level feeling, is a dream and goal of mine. CPU Intrinsics of ARMv8 and MIPS, Cryptography as in Eliptic Curve Public-Key Encryption and Emphemeral Key Exchange, as well as using it in TLS, is a priority of mine. 
- ðŸŒ± My Python3 is improving and I am using modules and classes correctly meanwhile; and have implemented basic cryptography and frameworks.
- âœ¨ My strongest programming languages are Python and Perl. I'm getting closer to C and know why Rust matters. I have so far implemented chat and webservers that perform through preforking and reduced system calls / IO in Perl, multithreading in Python. I am very familiar with Web Application Security in an Advanced Stage, Browser Automation and Fingerprinting, as well as basic Docker for Headless Chrome, and Basic Network Vulnerability Scanning. I am familiar with malware (detection) techniques and Reverse Engineering in theory and have read academic publications and code, but I could not implement it myself.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on awesome projects or eventually products that improve things we care about. I am looking to find collaborators and team members for my company Mescalin Semiconductor Ltd. eventually.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with various learning and implementation efforts, as well as advise and insight.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dan@mescalin.co
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/it
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like computers + cats.

My name is Dan Zulla. I was a 2013 Thiel Fellow.
