### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**zdanl** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because it contains and will contain `ethical` code for improving (digital) life. I am interested in a variety of technological and scientific subjects, and some of them require further learning and insight, while others require just funding or work. I am using this Github to elaborate on what is planned, and why you care.

Here are some things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Python3 libraries mostly for learning, ARM64 research and project planning, LLVM + clang source code review and patching, and market research.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Compilers & Lexers, CPU Intrinsics, Cryptography and Transport Layers, Advanced Python3
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on awesome projects or eventually products that improve things.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with clang+llvm/qemu||hqemu (Instruction Set Randomization) and creating a new programming language; Verilog synthesis & FPGAs, Cheminformatics, Linux on ARM64 laptop.
