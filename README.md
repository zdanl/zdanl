### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**zdanl** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because it contains and will contain âœ¨`ethical`âœ¨ code and projects for improving (digital) life. I am interested in a variety of technological and scientific subjects, and have vivid insight into a variety of industries. Some of the prospective achievements require further learning and insight, while others require just funding or work. I am using this Github to elaborate on what is planned, and why you care. I am an undergrad in Computer Science at Internationale Hochschule.

Here are some things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Python3 libraries mostly for learning, ARM64 research and project planning, LLVM + clang source code review and patching to implement Instruction Set Randomization, and market research into the semiconductor and neuropharmacological sectors.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Compilers & Lexers, CPU Intrinsics of ARMv8, Cryptography as in Public-Key Encryption and Key Exchange, as well as Transport Layer Security. 
- âœ¨ My strongest programming languages are Python and Perl. I'm getting closer to C and know why Rust matters.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on awesome projects or eventually products that improve things we care about.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with clang+llvm/qemu||hqemu (Instruction Set Randomization) and creating a new programming language; Verilog synthesis & FPGAs, Cheminformatics, Linux on ARM64 laptop.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
