### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨I am interested in a variety of technological and scientific subjects, care about ethical research & application of sciences, and have had vivid insight into a variety of industries ranging from data centers, over nanotechnology to biotech. Some of my prospective achievements require further learning and insight, while others require just funding (meetings) or work (time). I am using this Github to elaborate on what is planned, and why you should care. I am an undergraduate in Computer Science at Internationale Hochschule (IU). Please find my Notion page as well: https://zdanl.notion.site/zdanl-s-braindump-d742c830664441cfb7470d07d852c158  

Here are some things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning and working on Python3 libraries mostly for educational purposes, ARM64 research and project planning, LLVM + clang source code review and patching to implement Instruction Set Randomization, and market research into the semiconductor sector. Compilers & Lexers for creating a Python3 syntax and grammar based memory-safe language for low-level engineering with high-level feeling, is a dream and goal of mine. CPU Intrinsics of ARMv8 and MIPS, Cryptography as in Eliptic Curve Public-Key Encryption and Emphemeral Key Exchange, as well as using it in TLS, is a priority of mine. 
- ðŸŒ± My Python3 is improving and I am using modules and classes correctly meanwhile; and have implemented basic cryptography and frameworks.
- âœ¨ My strongest programming languages are Python and Perl. I'm getting closer to C and know why Rust matters. I have so far implemented chat and webservers that perform through preforking and reduced system calls / IO in Perl, multithreading in Python. I am very familiar with Web Application Security in an Advanced Stage, Browser Automation and Fingerprinting, as well as basic Docker for Headless Chrome, and Basic Network Vulnerability Scanning. I am familiar with malware (detection) techniques and Reverse Engineering in theory and have read academic publications and code, but I could not implement it myself.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on awesome projects or eventually products that improve things we care about. I am looking to find collaborators and team members for my company Mescalin Semiconductor Ltd. eventually.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with various learning and implementation efforts, as well as advise and insight.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dan@mescalin.co
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/it
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like computers + cats.

My name is Dan Zulla. I was a 2013 Thiel Fellow.

### Projects

- ðŸ”­ Helping Debian/Ubuntu to support the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c 2G Kyro 468 based Samsung Galaxy Go LTE which is ARM64 because it has only a 300$ price point, and anybody should be able to run Linux on a ARMv8 desktop.
- ðŸ“« Implementing AES runtime decryption for ELF32/ELF64 x86-64 and ARMv8 as a feature into the Python Compiler Nuitka as demonstrated in https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/18849-hyperion-implementation-of-a-pe-crypter.pdf
- ðŸ‘¯ Exploring High-Level Synthesis of Python3 code to Verilog for FPGA Accelerators or entire CPUs / SoCs https://www.llvm.org/devmtg/2010-11/Rotem-CToVerilog.pdf
- ðŸ¤” Adding Instruction Set Randomization based on XOR shuffling of opcodes into LLVM clang and HQEMU
- âš¡Obtaining Funding for Mescalin for 5 years of continued work on these and other projects with a team and collaborators, including full time salaries, hardware, prototypes, etc.

### Experience 

- ðŸ”­ I have worked as a web security penetration tester extensively, know the landscape of tools, can write and have written my own, know how to fix and exploit vulnerabilities, can review source code in a variety of languages and build secure web applications
- ðŸ“« Plenty of academic subjects have been vividly read and explored, ranging from security to many matters of computer science
- ðŸ‘¯ I am very familiar with the subject of browser fingerprinting and bot detection
